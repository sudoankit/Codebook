# Notebook 
This repo is a collection of _super_ useful code snippets in C++ (_some are in Java, also_)  for optimized and time-saving implementation of algorithms and tricks used in competitive coding, and propbably extend it for storing repetitive code for other projects.

:smile:

Have fun using them and please _pull a request_ for new cool additions, which you might know. Thank you! Here's some :chocolate_bar: for you. Sharing is great!

###Table of Contents 
Almost all of the code is in `C++`. Few algorithms and problems requiring `BigInteger`, ` java.util.Calendar`,`java.time` and some string based problems are _obviously_ implemented in `Java 7/8`. 

Without further ado, here's the list.
